This is a simple python script to generate a word search. The words are picked at random from a word pool that you can edit. You can also set the dimensions of the word search itself but be warned that if it does not fit within the dimensions of the document that it will get disorted. The default settings work fine on standard document dimensions. Unles you specify an output, the word search is exported to a txt file int the same area as the py script.
